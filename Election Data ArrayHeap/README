      Discussion: The peekTopN method takes in an integer as a parameter that is
                  the "n" that the user inputs. The ArrayList is copied into a new
                  ArrayList, called copy. Then the ArrayList is sorted using
                  the Collections.sort() function from the highest percentage to
                  the lowest. In a loop that goes from 0 to "n" the user-input
                  number, the first index of the ArrayList is saved into a
                  temporary variable and that variable is added to a new
                  ArrayList, topN, that stores the top n elements. When the loop
                  ends, the topN ArrayList will have the number of top elements
                  the user asked for, and the ArrayList is returned.
