   Known Bugs and Limitations: The cumulative rank for each name for all the years
                            totaled is not computed correctly

  Write Up: My Name class uses a String, an ArrayList of Info object, and an
            integer of total names as instance variables. The yearly statistics
            is stored in the ArrayList of Info objects, the total for each name
            for all years is an instance variable for the Name object and the
            total babies for each gender for each file is stored in Arraylists
            created in Main and passed as parameters to update in the ReadFile
            class. The total for all files for all years is calculated in the
            Main. The linked lists are kept in alphabetically sorted order
            by using the insertSorted method in the NameDLL class. The new names
            are inserted in a sorted manner in the linked lists and the information
            for the already existing names are updated in the readFile method.
            For the total rank, I use a findRank method in the NameDLL that
            takes in a Name object as a parameter and returns the rank, an integer.
            The method uses a while loop that traverses through the linked list
            as long as the total for the name object for all files is greater than
            the total for other names in the list, it increments a counter
            variable and when the total is less than the other total, it returns the
            counter variable + 1.
