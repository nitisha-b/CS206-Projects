	How to compile: 
	
	How to run it: java Main -i <filename> -o <output name> -c/-e -t (in no particular order)
	
	Known Bugs and Limitations:
	
		The thresholds used to compress the pictures are tested by checking the
		compression levels using (# of leaves/dimension) to approximately match the 
		compression levels in the project description. 
		
		The threshold used to call QuadTree for edge detection is pre-defined so 
		it is enough to trace the QuadTree. 
		
		The "threshold" used to decide when to set the pixels to black in the edge 
		detection method is also tested and hence pre-defined, and not calculated 
		on the fly. 
		
		The edge detection method does not always return pictures that are only black
		and white, but sometimes contains other colors too.
