2. Known Bugs and Limitations: The program takes a very long time to run/does
                              not run for some random numbers that are not
                              zipcodes.

                              It prints out "No such zipcodes" when
                              nothing is entered in the input stream.
      Discussion:
                 Assignment 2 uses a loops that go through all the elements in
                 the ArrayList to find a particular zipcode when weaving the two
                 files together and also while searching for the user-input zip.
                 The time command results for this assignment are as follows:

                    real	0m35.685s
                    user	0m36.267s
                    sys	0m0.103s

                Assignment 5, however, uses a binary search to weave the files as
                well as to search the user-input zipcodes. The binary search
                makes a significant difference in the time it takes to read the
                files and also to go through the ArrayList. The time results for
                this assignment are as follows:

                  real	0m0.504s
                  user	0m1.272s
                  sys	0m0.086s
